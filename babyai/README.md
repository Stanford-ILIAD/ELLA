# BabyAI Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mila-iqia/babyai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mila-iqia/babyai)

A platform for simulating language learning with a human in the loop. This is an ongoing research project based at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/).

## Replicating ICLR19 Results

The master branch of this repository is updated frequently. If you are looking to replicate or compare against the results from the [ICLR19 BabyAI paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX), please use the docker image, demonstration dataset and source code from the [iclr19 branch](https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai/tree/iclr19) of this repository.

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.5+
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- PyTorch 0.4.1+
- blosc

Start by manually installing PyTorch. See the [PyTorch website](http://pytorch.org/)
for installation instructions specific to your platform.

Then, clone this repository and install the other dependencies with `pip3`:

```
git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git
cd babyai
pip3 install --editable .
```

### Installation using Conda (Alternative Method)

If you are using conda, you can create a `babyai` environment with all the dependencies by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git
cd babyai
conda env create -f environment.yaml
source activate babyai
```

After that, execute the following commands to setup the environment.

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.git
cd gym-minigrid
pip install --editable .
```

The last command installs the repository in editable mode. Move back to the `babyai` repository and install that in editable mode as well.

```
cd ../babyai
pip install --editable .
```

### BabyAI Storage Path

Add this line to `.bashrc` (Linux), or `.bash_profile` (Mac).

```
export BABYAI_STORAGE='/<PATH>/<TO>/<BABYAI>/<REPOSITORY>/<PARENT>'
```

where `/<PATH>/<TO>/<BABYAI>/<REPOSITORY>/<PARENT>` is the folder where you typed `git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git` earlier.

Models, logs and demos will be produced in this directory, in the folders `models`, `logs` and `demos` respectively.

## Usage

To run the interactive GUI application that illustrates the platform:

```
scripts/manual_control.py
```

The level being run can be selected with the `--env` option, eg:

```
scripts/manual_control.py --env BabyAI-UnlockPickup-v0
```

### The Levels

Documentation for the ICLR19 levels can be found in
[docs/iclr19_levels.md](docs/iclr19_levels.md).
There are also older levels documented in
[docs/bonus_levels.md](docs/bonus_levels.md).

### Pixel Observations

Please note that the default observation format is a partially observable view of the environment using a compact encoding, with 3 input values per visible grid cell, 7x7x3 values total. These values are **not pixels**. If you want to obtain an array of RGB pixels as observations instead, use the `RGBImgPartialObsWrapper`. You can use it as follows:

```
import babyai
from gym_minigrid.wrappers import *
env = gym.make('BabyAI-GoToRedBall-v0')
env = RGBImgPartialObsWrapper(env)
```

This wrapper, as well as other wrappers to change the observation format can be [found here](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid/blob/master/gym_minigrid/wrappers.py).

## About this Project

BabyAI is an open-ended grounded language acquisition effort at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). The current BabyAI platform was designed to study data-effiency of existing methods under the assumption that a human provides all teaching signals
(i.e. demonstrations, rewards, etc.). For more information, see the [ICLR19 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJeXCo0cYX).
